GL On A Stick Demo
==================

GLoas is a demonstration of threaded OpenGL rendering.

It uses SDL2. Sorry, it just does. This is actually helps to prove the point, since GL Context creation is more restricted in SDL2 than in wgl, glx, and cgl.

GLoas demonstrates asynchronous GL data writing, queueing of GL commands, use of GL share lists (lite, we do this through SDL2), and sharing of windows between threads.

GLoas is released under the BSD 3-Clause license.
